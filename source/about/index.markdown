Hello, my name is Vladi Gleba, and I'm a web developer.

It all started in a 10th grade web design class. I had never seen HTML source code prior to it, and when the class was over, I knew web development was what I wanted to pursue. I was moonstruck and there was no going back.

Throughout high school, I continued learning web development on the side, and once college came around, I decided to study computer science since it was the closest thing to web development I could find.

Computer science expanded my horizons and introduced me to many new things, but apart from internships, my exposure to the web was limited. Now that I'm out of college, I'm back to studying web development full-time; the web is moving fast and there are many cool web technologies I want to learn.

I plan on using this blog as means of documenting my progress, and you're welcome to [follow along](http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=927939&cids=1), if you'd like. My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vladigleba), my work history is on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vladigleba), and a small fraction of my thoughts are on Twitter. You're also welcome to say hello at <inquiries@vladigleba.com>!
