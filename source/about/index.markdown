Hello, my name is Vladi Gleba. 

I was first introduced into the world of web development while taking a 10th grade web design class. Something clicked and I instantly knew web development was what I wanted to pursue and become great at, but I didn't know if this was something I could make a career out of or not.

Throughout high school, I continued learning web development on the side, and once college came around, I decided to study computer science since it was the closest thing to web development I could find.

Computer science expanded my horizons and introduced to me many things I never expected to learn. Even though the exposure to the web was extremely limited, I still gained some useful knowledge and skills that shaped me into the developer I am today.

Now that I'm out of college, I'm back to studying web development full-time and determined to make up for lost time. The web is moving fast and there are many cool web technologies I'm eager to pickup up!

I'll use this blog as means of documenting my progress, and you're welcome to [follow along](http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=927939&cids=1) if you'd like. My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vladigleba) and my work history on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vladigleba).

And of course, you're always welcome to say hello at <inquiries@vladigleba.com>.
