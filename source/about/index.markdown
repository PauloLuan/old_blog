Hello, my name is Vladi Gleba. I've been doing full-stack web design & development for over 2 years.

My interfaces are known for their intuitiveness and simplicity and my code for its efficiency and maintainability. I pay supreme attention to detail and firmly believe that an outstanding user experience is what makes it all sing. 

In my mind, the people who visit websites are not users, hits, or numbers on a spreadsheet. They're your wife, your dad, your friend, the guy who sits next to you on the bus ride home. As far as I know, the universe revolves around these people.

If you have a similar philosophy and think I might be a good fit for a project, feel free to get in touch at <inquiries@vladigleba.com>.
