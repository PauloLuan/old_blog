Hello, my name is Vladi Gleba, and I'm a web developer.

I was first introduced into the world of web development while taking a 10th grade web design class. Something clicked and I instantly knew web development was what I wanted to pursue and become great at. 

Throughout high school, I continued learning web development on the side, and once college came around, I decided to study computer science since it was the closest thing to web development I could find.

Computer science expanded my horizons and introduced to me many things, but the exposure to the web was extremely limited. Nevertheless, I still gained some useful knowledge and skills that shaped me into the developer I am today.

Now that I'm out of college, I'm back to studying web development full-time and determined to make up for lost time. The web is moving fast and there are many cool web technologies I'm eager to pickup up!

I plan on using this blog as means of documenting my progress, and you're welcome to [follow along](http://www.feedblitz.com/f/?Sub=927939&cids=1) if you'd like. My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vladigleba) and my work history on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vladigleba).

And of course, you're always welcome to say hello at <inquiries@vladigleba.com>.
