Starting a blog is something I wanted to do for a few years now, but I worried too much about not having enough time or things to write about, so I always put it off. 

But this weekend I had some free time on my hands and found myself googling around for blogging platforms for hackers. After some clicking around, I ran into Jekyll and was instantly intrigued by it. And now I'm sitting here typing up this post. 

I want to mention that since this is my first time venturing into the land of blogging, I want to apologize in advance if I make any rookie mistakes. Feel free to laugh and point it out. I will have a good laugh myself and hopefully learn from it.

My main goal with this blog is to share my web development knowledge. I plan on covering the side projects I work on and the technologies that power them. As an aspiring web developer, I heavily rely on other people's blogs to get stuff done, so I want to give back to the community and hopefully be of similar help to other aspiring web developers.

In my next post I'll be talking about the a side project I've been working on for quite a while now. It's already online and you can check it out at phindee.com.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
