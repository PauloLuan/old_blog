Starting a blog is something I wanted to do for a few years now, but I worried too much about not having enough time or things to write about, so I always put it off. But this weekend that all changed.

Having some free time on my hands, I found myself doing what I do best: gravitating towards the computer. I then caught myself googling for blogging platforms, and the rest, as they say, is history. After a few clicks, I stumbled into Octopress. The framework and I instantly clicked and I knew I found a winner.

Now I do want to mention that since this is my first try at blogging, I want to apologize in advance if I make any rookie mistakes. Feel free to laugh and point it out. I will have a good laugh myself and hopefully learn from it.

My main goal with this blog is to share my web development knowledge. I plan on covering the side projects I work on and the technologies that power them. As an aspiring web developer, I heavily rely on other people's blogs to get stuff done, so I want to give back to the community and hopefully be of similar help to other aspiring web developers.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
